# Form-Feed-Providers
Provider Feeds for use with Episerver forms

The intention of this project is to add additional feed providers for use with Episerver forms.  These may be generic and used across multiple use cases or they may be specific to target certain platforms or services.

The first set of feed providers will be to cover Json based feeds so that developers can hook into any RESTful service and return back data for form elements.
